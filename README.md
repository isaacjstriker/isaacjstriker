## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been enjoying web development for the first time ever since I completed my major Notris-Online project. The experience makes me want to dive headlong into creating more synchronous multiplayer experiences using WebSocket and Go.

I'm currently on the lookout for a role in web development, ideally writing Go or Python. I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
