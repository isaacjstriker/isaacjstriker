## Hi there 👋

I've been enjoying web development since I bagan taking online courses, and finishing an online mutliplayer game, Notris-Online. I'm currently on the lookout for a role in web development, ideally writing Go or Python. I'd especially love to work on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
