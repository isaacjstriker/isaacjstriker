## Hello, World

Backend developer specializing in Python and Go, though I must admit, I prefer Go. I'm usually scouring for repos to contribute to, completing challenges on boot.dev, or working on a personal project. If you know any good books on programming theory, please let me know. I need to add to my stack.
