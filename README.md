My name is Isaac Striker. Ever since enrolling in Boot.dev's computer science course, I've been building tools that are both practical and provide quantifiable improvements.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning Kubernetes
- ⚡ I do my best to write clear and concise code that is easy to understand for other developers
- 🔭 I love building new tools and putting my coding knowledge into practice
